# In Gratitude to Terry Davis

With heartfelt appreciation, we remember Terry Davis for his years of devoted labor on TempleOS. This operating system, crafted with love and a deep desire to glorify God, stands as a testament to his faith and creativity. While most operating systems are mere tools designed to serve human needs, TempleOS is a digital sanctuary, created to delight God and honor His Holy Name. Terry, your work will not be forgotten. Your legacy endures, not just as a technical achievement, but as a profound expression of devotion and ingenuity.

Through our Lord, Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever. Amen.

*“The Jews of the Old Testament wept for Jacob and for Moses for forty days. Today, however, during the funeral of the faithful, the Church raises hymns and prayers and psalms. We glorify and thank God, because “He crowned the departing,” because “He relieved the pains,” because “He expelled the fear,” and has the deceased believer near Him.  This is why the hymns and psalms reveal that in the event of death there is pleasure and joy following the glorious Resurrection of the Savior Jesus Christ. For the psalms and hymns are symbols of joy, according to the Apostolic word: “Is any cheerful? Let him sing praises” (James 5:13). This is why we sing psalms over the dead—psalms which move us to have courage and not to despair over the death of our brother.”* - Saint John Chrysostom
